# **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on Medical Data**

This project employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to assist users with medical inquiries by leveraging Wikipedia's medical data. The model offers accurate, comprehensive information across various topics in the medical field, including:

- **Symptoms**: Recognizing the signs associated with different medical conditions.
- **Treatments**: Recommended therapies, medications, and procedures for a range of health issues.
- **Precautions**: Preventative steps to minimize risks related to specific illnesses or health conditions.
- **Causes**: Underlying factors or conditions that contribute to disease onset.
- **Suggestions**: General advice for managing health and wellness.

The RAG model combines **information retrieval** and **language generation** techniques, using Wikipediaâ€™s vast repository of medical knowledge to answer user questions effectively. This approach ensures users receive reliable, evidence-based responses to their medical queries.

### Key Aspects of Model Design

#### 1. **Chunking Strategy for Optimized Retrieval and Generation**
   - **Chunk Length & Placement**: The impact of chunk length and information placement within chunks is analyzed to improve retrieval effectiveness. 
   - **Equal-Length Chunking**: A chunk-merging strategy, used after applying a recursive text splitter, ensures uniform chunk lengths, balancing both retrieval relevance and model performance.

#### 2. **Optimizing Retrieval and Generation**

- **For Retrieval**: Shorter text chunks yield higher similarity scores, enhancing retrieval accuracy and ensuring relevant information is precisely fetched.
- **For Generation**: Large language models (LLMs) perform best with broader context. To support this, the model includes metadata indices for adjacent chunks (previous and next), allowing the retriever to return neighboring chunks. This approach provides the generator with enriched context without requiring additional embeddings.

#### 3. **Customizable Nearest-Neighbor Retrieval**
   - The model allows flexible configuration of the number of neighboring chunks retrieved, adapting to different domains and retrieval needs. This customization enables enhanced context for the generator, improving generation quality across diverse applications.

By balancing chunk size, contextual linking, and retrieval customization, this RAG system achieves high-quality retrieval and enriched generation, ensuring optimal performance for medical data applications.
